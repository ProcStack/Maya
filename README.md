# Maya
Because Maya LT is limited... (In title and available functions.) There is no Python access in Maya LT and many good deformers are missing.
But I'm not shelling out more money for the full version of Maya. (Houdini for life!)

Tartarus is a script tool box I wrote back in 2007-2008 while in college.  (The toolbox has been shelved and shall not be added to. Bugs exist in the newer versions of maya, but all in all, still works to its initial design.)

Many of the topology scripts I wrote I still use today, along with the quick multi split script.
It may all be in Mel, but works fairly fast; so it will work in Maya LT

*Please note!!*---

For what ever reason, if a scene is set to centimeters, when importing an OBJ into Cura slicing software, that unit is read as milimeters, not centimeters.
So any distance reading scripts will assume for this aspect.
