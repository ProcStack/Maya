# Maya
Because Maya LT is limited
No Python access in Maya LT and many good deformers are missing.

I will be adding many of the scripts I wrote in college to this repository.

Many of the topology scripts I wrote I still use today, along with the quick multi split script.
It may all be in Mel, but works fairly fast.

The toolbox can be found here---

(Use the "Download Tartarus v2.01" link, the highend3d page no longer exists)

A functions list can be found here- http://tartarus.metal-asylum.net/functionsTools.htm


*Please note!!*---

For what ever reason, if a scene is set to centimeters, when importing an OBJ into Cura slicing software, that unit is read as milimeters, not centimeters.
So any distance reading scripts will assume for this aspect.
